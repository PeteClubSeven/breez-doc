# How do I add my podcast to Breez?

Breez uses the [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/) APIs and displays podcasts that added a Lightning value block to their feeds.
To add your podcast to the library of available podcasts in Breez, search for your podcast in the [Podcast Index](https://podcastindex.org/), click on the Lightning icon, and follow the [instructions](https://bowtiedchukar.com/setup-your-podcast-to-stream-sats/).

If you are having trouble registering, try to post in [this telegram group](https://t.me/podcasting20).

If you don't have a Lightning node and don't want to self-host, we recommend running a hosted podcast node from [Voltage](https://voltageapp.io/podcast).
